# Egguino's Christmas Rebrand
Assignment 1, 2, and 3 for DESN3031

All media, branding, and content was used with permission from the owner of Egguino.
Real website with content and products can be [on egguino.com](https://www.egguino.com)

I used Bootstrap, Flexbox, and CSS Grid to make different sections of each page.
I also used Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons for specific styling.

Features like the click, hover, and checkout form fields are partially implemented. Although you can click the "add to cart" button, it just brings you to a pre-programmed visual of the checkout page. The form submit button also is not implemented because there's no backend or data storage in this assignment.
